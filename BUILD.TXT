to build this project you must Apache Maven at least 2.2.1 .
mvn clean install will install the mojos without running integration tests (as there are some hardcoded integration tests with port 1973, you could have some port allocation issues).
mvn clean install -Prun-its will run integration tests too: to override the default used htpp port you can use -Dits.http.port=
To deploy a snaphot version to http://people.apache.org/repo/m2-snapshot-repository/ (which is proxying by https://repository.apache.org/content/groups/snapshots-group/) you must run : mvn clean deploy .
Note you need some configuration in ~/.m2/settings.xml:
    <server>
      <id>apache.snapshots</id>
      <username>your asf id</username>
      <!--password></password-->
      <!--privateKey>path to your private key</privateKey-->
      <!--passphrase></passphrase-->
      <filePermissions>664</filePermissions>
      <directoryPermissions>775</directoryPermissions>
    </server

If you have a nice ssh key in ~/.ssh/ no need of configuring password, privateKey, passphrase.
